## Installation:

CLIENT_MODE must be set to off for netmaker-gui to create networks properly;  netmaker functionality is not dictated by this setting, it is controlled by the CLIENT_MODE setting for the netmaker container.

```
netmaker-gui
  container-name: netmaker-gui
  image: nusak/netmaker-gui:v0.6.3
  restart: unless-stopped
  ports:

  environment:
    DATABASE: sqlite
    CLIENT_MODE: "off"
  volumes:
    - dnsconfig:/config/dnsconfig
    - sqldata:/data
```
